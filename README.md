## Elevator Extended

Finally, a nav bar which works like an elevator, by adding elevator music to add more
reality to the effect of the page.

This is a very serious stuff that will improve your UX 1000 times!!
Don't believe me? Demo coming soon!!

#### How to use

We are yet to figure out, so wait for us to complete writing the framework.

#### Notes

The idea is completely inspired by Tim Holman's Elevator.js. Huge shout out to
him for continuing making crazy things and inspiring people like us.
